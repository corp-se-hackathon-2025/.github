## 🗓️ Overview

Participants are encouraged to leverage GitHub Copilot to build innovative projects closely related to the GitHub ecosystem. Potential project areas include:

- **GitHub App Authentication** for secure access to GitHub.
- **Webhook or Audit Log Consumption** for tracking repository activities.
- **REST API Visualizations, Automations, or Integrations** to enhance workflow efficiency.
- **GitHub Actions** to automate CI/CD processes.
- **GitHub Copilot MCP Server** or custom **Copilot Extensions** (Client & Server).
- **Internal Tools** tailored to streamline team processes.

Explore, innovate, and showcase your skills!

## 🎯 Hackathon Goals

- Explore and showcase the power of Copilot.
- Innovate freely — customer demo or GitHub solution, your call!
- Share learnings, ideas, and inspire new customer conversations.
- Optionally, build something reusable or production-ready.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

- Access to GitHub Copilot (IDE extensions, CLI, Chat, etc.).
- GitHub repository to host your project (private or public).
- Familiarity with GitHub features (Actions, Apps, APIs) if participating in the Solution Track.

### 2. Project Repo Setup

- Fork or clone this README template.
- Rename your repository accordingly.
- Update the following sections:
  - Project Name & Description
  - Getting Started Instructions
  - Requirements/Tools/Languages

## 👥 Collaboration Tips

Time is limited (**2-3 hours**). Use Copilot to maximize productivity.

### 🟢 Recommended Collaboration Strategies

| Approach                   | Benefits                                                               |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **VS Code Live Share**     | Real-time pair programming, shared debugging, rapid iteration.         |
| **Divide & Conquer (Git)** | Work in parallel branches; quickly merge via PRs.                      |
| **Parallel Prototyping**   | Prototype separately; merge best elements.                             |
| **Prompt/Task Delegation** | Assign roles to manage prompts, code generation, and testing.          |
| **Clear Roles at Kickoff** | Set roles (Driver, Prompt Engineer, Tester, Doc Writer) to streamline. |

> **Tip:** Allocate your first 5-10 minutes to define collaboration methods clearly.

## 🛠️ Tools & Ideas for Success

| Tool/Feature       | Ideas                                                     |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Copilot Chat**   | Generate code snippets, automate tests, debugging advice. |
| **GitHub Actions** | Automate CI/CD, testing, deployment workflows.            |
| **GitHub Apps**    | Enhance team productivity and workflows.                  |
| **APIs**           | Build data visualizations, integrations, and dashboards.  |

## ✨ Example Project Ideas
- **Customer Demo:** Copilot-powered app demonstrating live code generation or feature enhancements.
- **GitHub Solution:** Automated Action for labeling issues based on AI-generated summaries or sentiment.
- **Internal Tool:** Dashboard integrating Copilot-generated insights from GitHub API activity.
