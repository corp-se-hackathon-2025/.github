# 🧑‍💻 GitHub Copilot Hackathon 2025

Welcome to the GitHub Copilot Hackathon! 🚀  
This is your chance to flex your creative muscles, explore the power of Copilot, and build something cool. Whether you're creating a compelling customer demo or a unique GitHub-powered solution, the goal is simple: **create something awesome with Copilot.**

---

## 🗓️ Overview

Participants have **two tracks** to choose from:

1. **Customer Demo Track**  
   Build an engaging, customer-ready demo that showcases the capabilities of GitHub Copilot (Chat, CLI, or Editor Extensions).

2. **GitHub Solution Track**  
   Develop a solution that leverages GitHub’s ecosystem — think:
   - **GitHub Actions**
   - **GitHub Apps**
   - **GitHub REST / GraphQL API integrations**
   - **Custom workflows, automations, or internal tools**

---

## 🎯 Hackathon Goals

- Explore and showcase the power of Copilot.
- Innovate freely — customer demo or GitHub solution, your call!
- Share learnings, ideas, and maybe even inspire new customer conversations.
- Optionally, build something that could be polished into a reusable demo or production-ready solution.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
- Access to GitHub Copilot (IDE extensions, CLI, Chat, etc.).
- A GitHub repo to host your project (create a new private or public repo as needed).
- Familiarity with basic GitHub features (Actions, Apps, APIs) if participating in the Solution Track.

### 2. Setup Your Project Repo
1. **Fork or clone this README template.**
2. Rename the repo to something relevant.
3. Update the following sections:
   - `Project Name & Description`
   - `Getting Started Instructions`
   - Any specific requirements/tools/languages.

## 👥 Collaboration Tips

You’ve only got **2-3 hours**, so working smart as a team is crucial. Copilot will handle a lot, but organizing your team’s efforts can make the difference between a solid project and a standout one. Here are some effective ways to collaborate:

### 🟢 Suggested Collaboration Strategies

| Approach                               | How It Helps                                                               |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **VS Code Live Share**                | Pair program in real time, share terminals, debug together, brainstorm on the fly. Great for fast iteration. |
| **Divide & Conquer via Git**          | Break the project into components (frontend, backend, GitHub Actions, docs). Use branches to avoid conflicts and PRs to review quickly. |
| **Parallel Prototyping**              | Each teammate builds their own version or piece using Copilot, then merge the best ideas. |
| **Prompt/Task Delegation**            | Some focus on writing effective prompts, future feature ideas, or testing tasks, while others implement core features. |
| **Clear Early Roles**                 | Assign roles right at the start (e.g., "Driver," "Prompt Engineer," "Tester," "Doc Writer") to avoid overlap and confusion. |

### 💡 Tip:
Decide **how you'll collaborate in the first 5-10 minutes**. A quick huddle upfront will pay off in smoother coding later.

## 🛠️ Suggested Tools & Ideas

| Tool/Feature         | Ideas |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Copilot Chat**     | Auto-generate boilerplate code, tests, scripts, etc.     |
| **GitHub Actions**   | Automate deployment, testing, or custom workflows.       |
| **GitHub Apps**      | Create an app that enhances team workflows.              |
| **REST/GraphQL API** | Build integrations, dashboards, or data-driven tools.    |

---

## ✨ Example Ideas

- **Customer Demo:**  
  A Copilot-powered web app where Copilot generates new features live during a walkthrough.

- **GitHub Solution:**  
  An Action that auto-labels issues based on AI-generated summaries.
