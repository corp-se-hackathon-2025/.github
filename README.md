## üóìÔ∏è Overview & Example Project Ideas

Put yourselves in the shoes of our customers.  For this hackathon, participants are encouraged to leverage GitHub Copilot to try to build innovative projects using tools from the GitHub ecosystem. Explore, innovate, and learn about our customers' experience! 

### Make it about the journey
This workshop is about using the process of creating an application to learn about our different tools.  Your goal is to learn about our tools, and tell us about what you learned.  It isn't to wind up with a working application by the end of the hackathon - although there's no reason not to try!

As part of this process you should think about the tools you're using and what expectations you have about them.  Do you expect to be able to build a UI in Agent mode?  Or do you expect there's no way it can get you there?  Is Copilot a peer programmer or a pair programmer?

You'll use the excercise of coming up with a project and implementing it as a team as the catalyst for your learning.  And at the end people can present their applications - working or not - and tell us about the lessons they learned using our tools.

## üë• Collaboration Tips

Time is limited (**2-3 hours**). Leverage Copilot effectively!

### üü¢ Recommended Collaboration Strategies

| Approach                   | Benefits                                                       |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **VS Code Live Share**     | Real-time collaboration and debugging.                         |
| **Divide & Conquer (Git)** | Parallel development; efficient merging via PRs.               |
| **Parallel Prototyping**   | Independent prototypes merged for best outcomes.               |
| **Prompt/Task Delegation** | Specialized roles for efficiency (prompting, coding, testing). |
| **Clear Roles at Kickoff** | Defined roles (Driver, Prompt Engineer, Tester, Doc Writer).   |

> **Tip:** Dedicate first 5-10 minutes to clearly define team strategies.
